##Weather Report

#Description
  Used JSON and Weather Underground API to pull data from the website and while focusing on Test Driven Development.

#Objectives
  This project helped me understand the structure of Web APIs while using JSON. I was able to use HTTParty for requests and merge the information from multiple API endpoints. Using the API from Weather Underground, I was able to find the current conditions of specific locations, a ten-day forecast, sunrise and sunset times, weather alerts, and list all active hurricanes.
