Deliverables

- An estimate. After you read through this assignment (but before you start coding),
write down a number of hours that you expect each part to take (1-3).
  7-8 hours

- Record your hours as you go.

- A GitHub repository.

- A quality README.

- A test suite. Not only must this test suite be conceptually complete,
  it must be written before the code that satisfies it.

- A reflection on your estimate. Well? How did you do?

- Use the homework submission form on the course website to
  turn in a link to your GitHub repository.
