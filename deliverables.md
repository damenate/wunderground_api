##Deliverables

- An estimate. After you read through this assignment (but before you start coding),
write down a number of hours that you expect each part to take (1-3).
  7-8 hours

- Record your hours as you go.
  5 hours at lab, then 1 hour at home. 6 total hours

- A reflection on your estimate. Well? How did you do?
  I did a lot better than I thought. Had I thought through the 10-day forecast more
  clearly then I would have finished sooner. I manually coded in the 10 days rather
  than using an obvious loop.
